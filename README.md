# adr-transformer-IOB-Schema

<p> Algorithm for transforming Doccano data into ** CoNLL 2003 ** or ** IOB ** </p>

<p> Before implementing the CRF (Conditional Random Fields) algorithm, it was necessary to classify the entities stored in the NoSQL database<br/>

<p>The Doccano software was used to classify the entities manually, using a Natural Language Processing technique. We created two entities called <strong> DRUG (Drug) </strong> and <strong> ADR (Adverse Drug Reaction)</strong>. The manual classification was applied to 5,000 tweets, of which only 750 contained both entities simultaneously in the tweet. The manually classified entities were exported to JSONL (text tag) format.
